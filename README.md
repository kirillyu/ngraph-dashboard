# ngraph-dashboard
Service dependency graph based on connections between nodes. 
It is based on this tool https://github.com/alebsys/ngraph
Dashboard totally based on nodes naming. Label "instance" totally include the host name.
In my case I have hosts like:
```
instance="evk-haproxy-02.prod.px.croc-comp.goods.local:9100"
instance="rancher-server-03.srv.px.croc-vol.goods.local:9100"
instance="compose-wra-01.prod.px.croc-comp.goods.local:9100"
```
